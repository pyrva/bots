> ðŸ’¡If someone can think of a way to write unit tests / pytests to test things like the raffle cog in particular I am all ears. My best case solution is to setup a Dev/Prod dynamic for testing but that feels like more work than its worth.

## Deployment:

fire and forget:
```zsh
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

if you want to use the docker-compose during development be sure to destroy/increment the image or the docker-compose will just use the same image over and over.
```
sudo docker-compose down --rmi all
```
> ðŸ’¡one potential solution to this is to mount the directory but seemed more trouble than its worth atm. This was faster and ultimately more robust
